        <h3>~ ABOUT ME ~</h3>
<hr>
<p> I am a graduate of the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff where I completed my bachalors degree, majoring in accounting and minoring in computer science. There I was a member of the track and field team and the Entrepreneurship Club. I chose to attend the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, because of the family-oriented and friendly nature of the students and professors. Currently I am a graduate student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff persuing a masters in Computer Science. I am the captain of the menâ€™s track and field team, I hold the position of treasurer for the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC), and I am a proud member of the Carolyn F. Blakely Honors College. I chose Computer Science as my major because business has always been my passion from an early age. Upon graduation, I plan to pursue a career in computer science as a data analysit or software engineer.
